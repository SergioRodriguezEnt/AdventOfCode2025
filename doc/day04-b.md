# Day 04 B
The task has expanded, we now need to **remove iteratively all possible paper rolls**.<br>
For this, we create the WallRemover class, which returns us the updated state of the wall for each iteration.<br>
Now, the Runner04B just needs to keep count of how many rolls have been removed.<br>
